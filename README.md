# Flow-Data-Caley-Water

## About Caley Water:
Caley Water is an environmental consultancy which specialises in the assessment of both sewer and clean water networks. Specialists in hydraulic modelling, we can carry out a range of modelling activities from new model builds to impact assessments and design solutions.Â 

## Aim:
Reviewing and Analysing Observed Rainfall and Flow Survey data for Model Verification

## Project Description
Caley Water receives and utilises observed rainfall and flow survey data for the use within catchment hydraulic modelling verification studies. This data is fundamental in developing reliable, high-quality hydraulic models to be used for a range of feasibility flooding impact assessments and future catchment development strategies. This project is primarily interested in reviewing and analysing this data with new and innovative approaches to gauge a broader understanding of the quality and application of this data. Our aim is to establish a process to provide statistical conclusions regarding the data quality to (1) aid the process of selecting event data to be used for Flow Verification; (2) evaluating the overall quality of the dataset; and (3) review or contrast against theoretical predictions.
